# remove paradox-launcher from appdata
This script is created as a workaround for an unknown issue that prevents the paradox launcher from displaying. After much trial and error, I found that my only solution is to remove the launcher files and reinstall every time I run the game exe. Powershell `ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` is required.
